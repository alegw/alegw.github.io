# How I am spending my time
1. Developing a career as a human-centered design professional. I'm currently **Product Designer at [mycs.com](http://de.mycs.com)**,
where I engage in user research, redesign crucial aspects of the customer experience and
help develop a company culture centered around user needs.

2. Drafting lessons to teach computer science fundamentals to children in Hispanic America, starting next March.

3. Planning to do some deep reading and learning to surf somewhere off the beaten path later this month.

4. Savoring life with family and friends.

# My hand computer's main screen
A screen we look at many times a day should reflect our priorities. This is
what mine looks like right now.

Hand computer? Yeah, maybe we should call “smartphones” what they really are 😉.
