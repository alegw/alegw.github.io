reflecting on how to best create a culture of computer science knowledge.
* Putting together a multimedia story for a great educational startup.

# My hand computer's main screen
A screen we look at many times a day should reflect our priorities. This is
what mine looks like right now. And yeah, maybe we should call “smartphones” what they really are.
