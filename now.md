# How I am spending my time
1. Developing a career as a human-centered design professional. I'm currently **Product Designer at [mycs.com](http://de.mycs.com)**,
where I engage in user research, redesign crucial aspects of the customer experience and help develop a company culture centered around user needs.

2. Drafting lessons to teach computer science fundamentals to children in Hispanic America, starting next March.

3. Reading Jos√© Ignacio Cabrujas and surfing in Playa Venao, Panam√°.

4. Savoring life with family and friends.

# My hand computer's main screen
A screen we look at many times a day should reflect our priorities. This is
what mine looks like right now.

Hand computer? Yeah, maybe we should call ‚Äúsmartphones‚Äù what they really are üòâ.
