How do we make sure we attract people from all walks of life into the world's new open financial
system? We start by researching common attitudes towards technology, investing and using money.

In 2016, about [60% of Coinbase users were approaching bitcoin as a store of
value](http://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/Bitcoin-Ringing-The-Bell-For-A-New-Asset-Class.pdf).
Will that hodl for the next million users of cryptoassets? How about the next billion?

I decided to interview a few tech-savvy friends who had heard of bitcoin but
were holding out on their first purchase. I found the first thing we should redesign
at Coinbase is **the onboarding process**. Here are a few reasons why this
process still involves a lot of friction, and some ideas on how to make it smoother.

# People don't realize they can buy fractions of bitcoin
The first thing my friends told me when I asked them why they hadn't yet gotten
into bitcoin despite wanting to was "Hey, I don't have a spare $7000 in cash to
buy *a* bitcoin". They're financially and technically capable (one of them
works at Google!), yet they thought bitcoin was only traded in whole units, like
stocks.

- Sell *satoshis* to first-time users.
Whole numbers are more tangible and understandable. Buying 1000 satoshis *feels*
better than buying 0.00001 bitcoin.

# People can't decide how much to purchase
Sure, the Coinbase app tried to convince my friend to buy his first $5 in
bitcoin, but he had heard the on-chain fees averaged $2. That buy didn't make sense.
We need to give users a little nudge so they buy with a concrete suggestion
that caters to them.

- Suggest the user to invest his Venmo balance in bitcoin. My
  friend had over $400 that he hadn't needed in months, and this transaction
could probably be processed much quicker than through traditional banks.
- Prompt the user to invest $100 while showing the BTC/USD graph over a certain
  period. I know, we have to be careful not to give investment advice, but we can word it carefully.

# People want to avoid fees
My friend had read people complaining about high fees [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/908670197078413313), and opened
other tabs to look into the competitors' rates.

- Offer a fee-free first purchase to dismiss this concern altogether. Even
  better: waive the fee for debit cards to ensure a seamless purchase. This
  could end up being more appealing than getting $10 free for the first $100.

# People want to complete the process soon
To avoid card fees, my friend ended up linking his bank account, an
error-prone process as his bank wasn't listed, and waiting for 4 business days.
He expressed his frustration at having his money "floating around", 
especially since the price of bitcoin rose during those days.

- Offer instant connections to banks' emerging payment systems like
  [Zelle](https://www.zellepay.com/).

# People don't trust pull systems as much
Even after connecting his bank, my friend hated the thought of Coinbase having
complete access to his online banking. This resonated with me: I've always been
more comfortable using Coinbase in Europe, where you manually approve each IBAN
transaction. [Push rather than pull](https://coincenter.org/entry/how-are-payments-with-bitcoin-different-than-credit-cards).

- We can't revolutionize the US banking system in an afternoon, so the best we
  can do is to keep building trust. How about improving those [really terrible Google reviews](/img/coinbase-google-reviews.jpg)?

# People want to be follow a guided path
My friend reported the onboarding process had "felt scattered", and manually
had to go to settings to complete some pending verifications before being able
to buy. He compared Coinbase's process unfavorably to [Robinhood's](https://www.robinhood.com/).

- At my previous company, we were able to greatly increase engagement in making
  customizable furniture by [replacing the toolbox with a more guided funnel](/projects/mycs/).
This would also work here.

# That's it!
Reducing friction on first purchases will surely contribute to create a more
inclusive environment. The space is still too daunting and volatile
for the average consumer, so a good next step would be educating him on 
[smart investment strategies](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond/dp/1260026671/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=cityhammercom-20&linkId=a8fdda8139de4491d304a4e34685f34).
We can embed mini-lessons in the app in a delightful way, much like [Albert](http://meetalbert.com/) does.
