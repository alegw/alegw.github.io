Thanks for dropping by. Here are a few quick wins that could improve the experience of using your products.

# Provide system feedback when the microphone is on
When the user taps on
the microphone button, she typically sees little to no change in the system as the button turns into
a sound level meter, because the user typically looks for a very quiet space to perform speaking tasks.

This can be a great cause of confusion for first-time users, as I verified when I observed two family members
struggle and fumble with the mic button. 

The system status should be evident. A solution can be to visibly change the button's color when it is tapped.

# Differentiate active from disabled buttons

When the user submits a report, the button's gray changes very subtly to a lighter shade. This is noticeable for
young people and designers, but not for users at large.

I understand the *Report* button may be grayed out from the start to discourage people from being trigger-happy 
about reporting, so perhaps in this instance it would be best to remove the button altogether when a report has been filed.

# Adjust typo sensitivity when learning alphabet practice words

When the user is learning an alphabet on Tinycards, the system is too tolerant of mistakes. "где" is "gde", but the system
accepts "lde" as correct.

A three-letter word should be marked wrong if there is a single typo.

# Deep dives and future work
I would like to work with you to:

- Design a more effective onboarding experience for Duolingo Clubs.
- Foster more healthy competition inside your club through tailored notifications, challenging club friends to reach certain milestones, etc.
- Follow the company's roadmap to continue building effective and engaging educational products.
