In the context of solving human problems using computers, the most daunting challenge lies not on the technical process of building a piece of software, but in crafting an experience that puts people in the center, where the system communicates clearly and empowers the user to achieve her goals. This is where thoughtful design and solid engineering meet.

#### Design
First, I strive to obtain a deep understanding of people's needs with user research techniques. With these insights, I identify a problem by making informed assumptions that will have to be re-examined in future iterations. Next, I explore the solution space by thinking creatively, often with groups of people.

#### Prototyping
Then comes the phase I most enjoy working in: prototyping. It is about combining what has been envisioned by design to what can be (quickly) built by engineering, and putting it in front of the people for a humbling lesson that makes you learn and reiterate.

#### Shipping
The last step is shipping. The product can always be made better, so it makes sense to plan for the minimum viable version and ship it as soon as it's ready. Insights will come much quicker while in production.
