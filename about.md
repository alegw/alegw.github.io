I work at the intersection of people and software. I love to make connections with people from all kinds of backgrounds and discuss what technologists can and should be doing to empower people to lead autonomous, masterful, purposeful lives.

I have taken on roles of **user researcher, user experience designer, user interface designer and software engineer**.

I believe time and attention span are people's most valuable resources, as great breakthroughs occur when we allow time for serendipity. I am particularly passionate about education, and love teaching. Lately, I've been more involved in journalism, economics and public policy.
