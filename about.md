I work at the intersection of humans and software. I like making connections with experts in diverse backgrounds to discuss what technologists can do to empower people, so more of us lead autonomous, masterful, purposeful lives. More specifically, I am working towards **improving computer science education for kids across Hispanic America**.

I have taken on the roles of **product designer**, **user researcher**, and **software engineer**.

*Let's build useful, usable, beautiful software products.*

*Let's teach kids to weave their imaginations using code.*

*And let's start up a learning society.*
