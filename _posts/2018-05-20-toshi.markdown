In late 2017, I became enthralled with the potential of trustless general-purpose computation, 
so I decided to explore how design practices could improve adoption of decentralized technologies.

Toshi is one of the products I was (and still am) most excited about, since it allowed 
me to send money to loved ones in Venezuela who were uninitiated in cryptocurrency. 
It wasn’t easy, but it was possible! I did a two-day deep dive – heuristic evaluations, 
interviews, rapid prototyping – to suggest user experience improvements. 

I published my process and findings as a two-part series on Medium. 

The first one [focuses on end users](https://medium.com/@alegw/designing-toshi-for-the-next-3-billion-862f2ad9072c).

The second one [caters to developers](https://medium.com/@alegw/encouraging-devs-to-build-for-toshi-af9ba905428e).
