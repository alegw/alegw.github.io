Zeppelin was in need of a website redesign, so I worked alongside them to create user personas borne out by extensive interviews with software developers, clients, and partners.

In just over a month we shipped a brand new website that caters to these personas and explains Zeppelin’s value propositions better. We expect the new site will perform better at screening security audit applicants for quality.

During May and early June 2018, I’m researching how developers from other backgrounds journey into Ethereum to update OpenZeppelin’s guides, so that smart contract development becomes more straightforward to learn.
