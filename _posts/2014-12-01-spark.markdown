Spark is an application that aims to foster well-being by
encouraging people to take part in daily challenges with a virtual community.
We designed it as part of our Capstone Project of the Master in Human-Computer Interaction program.

I researched about technology for well-being and built the prototype for the iOS version, which is
currently available for a group of private beta testers. You can watch a quick
demo below: the password is **dailychallenge**.

# The process

You can find a detailed account of our eight-month-long journey at the 
[project's official website](http://spark.m-iti.org/).
Here's a lightning summary:

- Our client provided us with an initial direction that we developed into a
  **hunt statement**.
- We performed research to crystallize the direction into a concept.
    - Reading relevant literature
    - Interviewing experts
    - Comparing existing apps
    - Conducting an exploratory survey
- We focused on an idea: **to challenge people to break out of their routine**.
- We developed an email-based prototype that implemented the idea above, and
  had real people use it for a number of days. This is called a **concept probe**.
- We refined the concept through speed dating and low-fidelity prototypes.
- We crafted an interactive, high-fidelity prototype as a native iOS app that
  illustrated the final concept.

# The team
We were four people sharing the responsibilities of researching,
brainstorming, usability testing, and process-tweaking.

I was also responsible for engineering the interactive prototype using Swift 
and the iOS SDK.
