# UI Design
I worked at [zazzle.com](http://www.zazzle.com) as a location-independent UI designer
during early 2015.  Collaborating closely with the rest of the Design Team in California,
I followed a quick research–explore–prototype methodology to develop Zazzle's style guide
and improve consistency across their digital channels: website, mobile apps and emails.

# Experience Design
During the summer of 2014, I worked as an Experience Designer Intern with
Zazzle's Product Team. We studied user archetypes by developing personas from customer
visits and designed a push notifications service for Zazzle's mobile app.
[Matt Appleby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-appleby-21446269)
and I envisioned and prototyped a new app using Sketch, Quartz Composer and the iOS SDK.
