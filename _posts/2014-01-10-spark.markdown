As part of a team of four, in 2014 I worked with a multimedia agency based in
Funchal to design and develop an application to foster well-being by
encouraging people to participate in unexpected daily challenges.

We conducted exhaustive research and tested prototypes of varied fidelities,
throughout several iterations, as a means to refining our concept and
delivering a product that is both useful and usable. A more detailed account
can be found on the [project's official website](http://spark.m-iti.org/).

Besides leading the user research efforts with my teammates, I built working
prototypes of the application using the iOS SDK. Our team performed usability
tests with these models so that we could quickly decide what changes to make,
based on the users' feedback.
