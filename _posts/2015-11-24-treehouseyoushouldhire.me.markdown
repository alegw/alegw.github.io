I've been interested in education and technology all my life.

[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) is one of the educational companies that I most admire, not only because they have a superb product for teaching technologies, but because they have a 
culture that prioritizes a healthy work-life balance and location independence.

During late 2015, I decided to send them an unsolicited “cover website” with ideas for projects we could develop together. [Here's the final website I sent them](http://www.treehouseyoushouldhire.me/).

[![The website opens with a short personal video introducing myself and six directions for the future of Treehouse.](/img/treehouseyoushouldhire.me/website.jpg)](http://www.treehouseyoushouldhire.me/)

# Research
I read a lot about the progress of educational technology companies and have been a Treehouse student since 2013. I had wanted to make a strong pitch for Treehouse to hire me for a long time, so I started reading their blog more often and writing down spontaneous ideas for improvements. It was a brainstorming session that spanned months.

Out of these ideas, I created six standalone projects. For each of them I carefully crafted: 

- A list of goals
- An elaboration of the concept
- How to measure its impact
- What I personally could could contribute to it

This list closely mirrors [Treehouse's own process to propose a new project](http://ryancarson.com/post/61606695537/how-to-set-priorities-create-budgets-and-do).

# Making a website
HTML and CSS are easy in principle, but making a website from scratch always seems such a daunting task.

- What are the latest standards?
- How do I make sure I follow them?
- How do I ensure cross-browser compatibility?

I tackled these issues by getting a standards-compliant [site builder called Foundry](http://themeforest.net/item/foundry-multipurpose-html-variant-page-builder/11562108). I hand-coded the changes I needed without a hitch.
