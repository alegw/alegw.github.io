I've been interested in education and technology all my life.

[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) is one of the educational companies that I most admire, not only because they have a superb product for teaching technologies, but because they have a 
culture that prioritizes a healthy work-life balance and location independence.

During late 2015, I decided to send them an unsolicited “cover website” with ideas for projects we could develop together. [Here's the final website I sent them](http://www.treehouseyoushouldhire.me/).

[![The website opens with a short personal video introducing myself and six directions for the future of Treehouse.](/img/treehouseyoushouldhire.me/website.jpg)](http://www.treehouseyoushouldhire.me/)

# Research
I read a lot about the progress of educational technology companies and have been a Treehouse student since 2013. I had wanted to make a strong pitch for Treehouse to hire me for a long time, so I started reading their blog more often and immediately writing down ideas for improvements. It was like a brainstorming session that spanned months.

(more soon...)
