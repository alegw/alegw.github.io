Surge is a system that encourages people to spontaneously plan events with their extended friend circles.

I am in charge of its technology stack, develop the iOS app, and oversee the Android development process.

Weâ€™re using [Parse](parse.com) as our backend and database, [Layer](layer.com) for chat integration, and push notification services.

The app is not yet in the App Store, but you can play a [demo video here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/65ffboqyar0efub/ComeWith%20Demo.mp4?dl=0).
