Surge is a system that encourages people to spontaneously plan events with their extended friend circles.

I am a co-founder in charge of its technology stack, taking design decisions and overseeing the development process. Until recently, I was the sole developer for its iOS app.

Weâ€™re using [Parse](parse.com) as our backend and database, [Layer](layer.com) for chat integration, and push notification services.

The app has been in development since October 2015, is currently in private beta and will hit the app stores soon. You can contact me if you want to learn more about it in the meantime.
