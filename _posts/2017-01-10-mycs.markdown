[mycs](https://de.mycs.com/) is a company that sells high-end
customizable furniture directly to consumers in Germany, France and Switzerland.
Their core digital product is the **configurator**, a web app that lets visitors 
create personalized shelves, tables, wardrobes and sofas.

As the first UX hire, I kickstarted the user research process to find out about customers, their attitudes
on technology and purchasing behavior. I then **led a full redesign of the furniture configurator, 
improving sales and engagement metrics**. I am responsible for further usability improvements, 
designing interaction flows for new furniture types and adapting the web app to smaller form factors.

# User Research

#### Who are the users?

When I arrived at mycs, there was little consensus on who the users were.
Stakeholders had different ideas about the age composition, preferred browsing devices and their
attitudes towards technology. I set out to create characters based on data (personas) so the
nascent Product team and the company as a whole could relate and empathize with customers easily.
To this end, I analyzed Google Analytics data and conducted semi-structured interviews 
with the direct sales team. Two key insights were:

- most of our users were around age 45
- most of our users live with a partner and make decisions together

These findings made us adjust the company's assumption that the people who want our
products would generally be looking for the best price possible — they prefer to buy products of high quality.
We also adjusted our expectations of visitor conversion times, as we learned that purchasing furniture
can be a tricky and lengthy discussion in every household.

#### What are the users struggling with?

Knowing that [most people are not very good at performing complex computer tasks](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/),
we sought to uncover the usability issues affecting our configurator. To this end, we recruited participants for think-aloud tests.

This was the shelf configurator before the redesign:

People who visited this page:
- spent considerable time staring at the screen without interacting.
- expressed confusion when changing a value immediately altered another (e.g.  changing the width would change the number of columns).
- saw the icons on the right (size, color, boards, fronts and overview) as a *toolbox*, and frequently 
switched back and forth between these tools.

# Configurator Redesign

Together with the company's founder and the product manager, I brainstormed a configurator design
based on proven user needs and causes for the problems observed in tests.

**Observation:** the user spends considerable time staring at the screen without interacting.

**Cause:** he doesn't know where to start.

**Ideas for improvements:**.

- What if the system communicated directly through a conversational interface?
- What if the configurator was made of sequential steps, reducing the number of
  options available at any given point?
- What if we employed coachmarks for walking the user through his first visit?

I led several rounds of brainstorming, sketching proposals, making and testing clickable static-screen prototypes.

Sometimes we wanted to quickly test an interaction more complex than static-screen
prototypes allow, so I coded demo iOS apps to simulate them. Here's an example of a drag-and-drop interface.

After a few weeks of iterating and working closely with the Engineering team, we shipped brand new
configurators for four different furniture types, keeping an eye on weekly analytics. The redesign
was a success, resulting in improved sales and better engagement **(users made 34% more changes and
saved 116% more products to buy later).**


# Try the configurator yourself
Visit the [shelf configurator](https://nl.mycs.com/shelf/FwSSDKLSv) and create your own shelf, step by step. You
can also create a custom [sofa](https://de.mycs.com/sofa-joyn/ziD6P9KQZ),
[wardrobe](https://de.mycs.com/kleiderschrank/ziFo0Cy1Z) or
[table](https://de.mycs.com/tisch/pH9dsLAfX).

# The configurator in tiny screens
mycs is getting more and more mobile traffic. While we don't expect people to
commit to a large purchase on their phones, we want to offer a full customization experience 
that they can complete seamlessly on their tablets or computers at a convenient time.

I made several proposals for the mobile shelf configurator in the form of
clickable prototypes, optimized for 4-inch iPhones — the narrowest device we
decided to support. [Interact with the prototype here](http://invis.io/5WD8S4FEM).

# Next steps

We are still struggling with a high bounce rate: some visitors are leaving the app without making a single
change. One hypothesis is that people end up in the configurator before they
are ready to start configuring, so we are working out ways to expose them to
more product inspirations [without overwhelming them](http://coglode.com/gem/choice-paradox).
