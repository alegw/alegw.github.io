[mycs](mycs.com) is a Berlin-based company that sells high-end customizable furniture directly to European consumers.
Our core product is the Furniture Configurator, where visitors can create and tweak designs to 
buy custom shelves, tables and wardrobes.

As the first UX hire, I kickstarted the user research process to find out about our customers, their attitudes
on technology and purchasing behavior. I then led a full redesign of the Furniture Configurator web app, improving key performance metrics. I am currently responsible for further usability improvements, for designing interaction flows for new furniture types and for adapting it to smaller form factors.
